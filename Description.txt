Hello, good evening or morning wherever you are, My name is Richard,a web developer from the 31st century. I travelled back in time in order to understand the core ethics of programming starting in the 20th century.... In order for me not to get displaced in time i hid who i was until now....only you who is reading this knows this about me...I'm still learning 21st century programming so bear with me if i'm acting like i learner.
i know 31st century programming but unfortunately i can't teach you because of time dispalcement and to avoid time aberations....I hope you understand me reader... Goodday.
